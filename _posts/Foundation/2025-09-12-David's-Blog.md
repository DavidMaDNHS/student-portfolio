## My Story

Here are some of the places I’ve lived.

<style>
    .grid-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr));
        gap: 10px;
    }
    .grid-item {
        text-align: center;
    }
    .grid-item img {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100px;
        object-fit: contain;
    }
    .grid-item p {
        margin: 5px 0;
    }
</style>

<div class="grid-container" id="grid_container"></div>

<script>
    var container = document.getElementById("grid_container");
    var http_source = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/";

    var living_in_the_world = [
        {"flag": "f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg", "greeting": "你好", "description": "Shanghai, China — Birth to 2017"},
        {"flag": "a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "greeting": "Hello", "description": "San Diego, California — 2017 to present"},
    ];

    for (const location of living_in_the_world) {
        var gridItem = document.createElement("div");
        gridItem.className = "grid-item";
        var img = document.createElement("img");
        img.src = http_source + location.flag;
        img.alt = location.flag + " Flag";
        var description = document.createElement("p");
        description.textContent = location.description;
        var greeting = document.createElement("p");
        greeting.textContent = location.greeting;
        gridItem.appendChild(img);
        gridItem.appendChild(description);
        gridItem.appendChild(greeting);
        container.appendChild(gridItem);
    }
